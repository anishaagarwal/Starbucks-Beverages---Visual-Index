# Hello Starbucks!

This is a data visualization project that creates a visual index for select Starbucks beverages based on content of the ingredients used.

## What's in this project?


← `index.html`: This is the main HTML page for the site.

← `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content.

← `script.js`: Adding interactivity to the site with JavaScript (p5.js).

← `.eslintrc.json`: This one is weird! Best to leave it alone. All it's doing is setting some rules to prevent a bunch of unnecessary red dots appearing in your Javascript file.
